### October 2022

This is a study case where I positioning myself as a **junior data analyst** in the **marketing analytics team** at **Cyclistic (Divvy)**, with **responsibility** to get **insight from historical data** and **lead to new marketing strategy** espescially to shift casual riders to annual members. All works done in this project conducted **using R language**, with the details are following: 
* Defined **business problem** to solve
* **Gathered, ensure data credibility** and **cleaned data** from Divvy company historical data. (**January - December 2021**)
* Created **custom metrics** and **analyzed** stasticial summary of dataset.
* Did **analysis** based on **several metric**s too see **difference** between **casual** riders and **member** riders.
* Give **4 recommendations** for company regrading company's marketing strategist to **shift casual riders become members based on the story that data tells**.

## [Development of Auto Landing Deep Learning Model for Boeing 747 Aircraft](https://github.com/adikelvianto/Auto_Landing_DL)
### October 2022
This project aim to create **auto landing deep learning model** using TensorFlow by utilizing **"Flight Data Recorcder"** data. 
* Preprocessed **Flight Data Recorder (FDR)** data, with a total of **20GB csv files**; **Split dataset** for training, validation, and testing.
* Bult **elevator** model and **throttle** model using **TensorFlow** and **KerasTuner** to conduct hyperparameter tuning.
* The next **development** of this project is to **deploy** it to **MATLAB/Simulink and X-Plane** to see wether this models can do their job as an auto landing control system.* 

<p> Here are some **comparison** between **model prediction** value and **actual value**, **both** for elevator model and throttle model.  </p>

## [Deep Learning Based Fly-Over Waypoints Control System for Business Jet Aircraft](https://github.com/adikelvianto/Fly-Over_Waypoints_ANN)
### September 2022
This is my undergradute thesis project, with the goals are to **develop waypoint following controller deep learning model** espescially for **Cirrus Vision SF50** aircraft and **study the relationship between training data** that categorized by aircraft roll angle during the mission. This study give results that deep learning model generally increase closeness of the aircraft to the waypoint compared to the PID method, eventhough the dataset used is a piece of sliced data. It also shown that **wider datasets didnâ€™t guarantee superior results** due to generalizations that model try to made.

What I've done on this project are:
* **Set up communication environment** to be able retrieve data from X-Plane as flight simulator to be processed in MATLAB/Simulink to give control signal back to X-Plane.
* **Tuned PID controller** that allow the choosen aircraft accomplish flight mission with least of oscillation or swaying movement. 
* **Collected** 10 flight **missions data** with various forms of mission flight path and split each section of waypoint leg based on roll angle range resulting into **4 characterized train datasets**.
* **Resampled data frequency, removed outliers, data smoothing, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to select features for the model.
* Created TensorFlow base model and did **hyperparameter tuning** from 4 different datasets using **Bayesian Method** that provided by **KerasTuner**. 
* **Converted TensorFlow model** so that it can **be used in Simulink** to **validate** models performance when controlling aircraft **in X-Plane** to accomplish flight mission.  
* **Analyzed** effects of train dataset espescially in **roll angle range** to the perfromance of the controller created from 4 different models trained from different dataset. 

<p> This video shown below, show how aircraft being controlled to follow the waypoint based on 1 of 4 deep learning model created.</p>

## [Neural Style Transfer using AdaIn Method](https://github.com/Artjuna/artjuna-monorepo/tree/main/model/style_transfer)
### June 2022
This is my **capstone project** at **Bangkit Academy 2022** that awarded as **top 53** capstone team **semifinalist** out of 433 teams. My job as machine learning cohort was create Neural Style Transfer (NST) model using AdaIn Method by utilizing TensorFlow 2.x. **Neural style transfer** is an optimization technique used to **blend two images** become one image, where the reconstructed image will **preserve the object from content image**, while **transfering style** such as brushstroke from style image.

Image dataset that i used contain of **"PASCAL VOC"** dataset and validation set of **"COCO-2017"** as content image (arround **14k** images) and style image dataset consisting **"Best Artwork of All Time"** and **"Wikiart"** dataset (arround **13k** images) 

What i've done on this project are: 
* **Processed** arround **27k images** to have size of 224x224, **convert** it to **tfrecords** format to enable **parallelization training**, and **split the dataset** into train, validation and test dataset. 
* Created style transfer model using **AdaIn** method, which consist of **encoder** model that based on sliced **VGG-19** pretrained model, **decoder** that basically inverse of the encoder model also AdaIn function to allign statistical features of content image and style image. 
* **Trained model** with those image datasets for 500 epochs and analyze the reconstructed image every 10 epochs to see performance of NST model. 

<p>This is an example of image reconstruced based on model that I built.</p>

## [Prototype Webiste based Application for Avionic Components Failure Prediction](https://github.com/adikelvianto/Avionic-Components-Failure-Prediction)
### December 2021
This is my **internship** project at **PT. GMF Aeroasia Tbk**. for about **4 months**. In this project, I created a **prototype website** to give **failure prediction** of VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) and Multimode Control Panel components, by using **scikit-learn** library, **HTML, CSS and Flask.**

What I've done on this project are: 
* Collected information regarding maintenance from "Internal Component Refurbishment" documents both for VOR component (19 sub test) and Multimode Control Panel component (23 sub test) to **create 2 datasets**.
* **Split dataset** into train, validation and test dataset and did "**Nested Cross Validation**" method to get **best hyperparameter** for each machine learning algorithm used (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Gaussian Naive Bayes, KNN, MLP).
* **Picked 3** best perform algorithm for both component that give **best accuracy** on test set **to be deployed** on website. 
* Created structure of the website using HTML with total of **5 pages**, designed using CSS and a bit of JavaScript to allow value stored in each toggle button changed when user give a click. 
* **Deployed** the website by using **Flask API** and help of **Heroku** platform as a **server**. 

Result of the deploy website can be found [**here**](https://avionic-failure-prediction.herokuapp.com/)

## [Cargo Airlines Financial Analysis](https://github.com/adikelvianto/Aglis_Air_Cargo)
### December 2021
This is a **team project** done on my 7th semester for **"Aviation System Planning" class**, which requires each team to create an aviation business from raw and will be evaluated by experienced people on this area. In this project, we decided to create a **cargo airline** named **"Aglis"** which focuses on delivering marine products and general goods. In this project, I have a **duty as Chief Finance Officer (CFO)** that conduct several task such as:

* **Find** the **most suitable aircraft** to be used also the **number of aircrafts needed** to serve demand we have.
* Create **maintenance schedule** to determine non operating days and make sure all aircraft is airworthy.
* Calculate **cost structure** of cargo airline company consisting of direct, indirect and ownership costs.
* Conduct **profitability analysis** and **calculate** the **price** we need to give **each kilogram** of cargo for each route we served.
* **Analyze profit** earn each year, create **cash flow** for **10 years period** and calculate **Net Present Values** and **Net Profit Margin** earned.
